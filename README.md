# uTesla

uTesla (_microTesla_) is a small in size, but definitely impressive Tesla coil. It's core drive circuitry is inspired by [Tefatronix](https://tefatronix.g6.cz/)'s (fellow Czech fella!) SSTC IV. The driver runs on 24V (up to 28V for those feeling adventurous) and is controlled by an ATmega328P microcontroller with an SD card slot.
